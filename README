A gem that allows controller specs to generate markup which can be used as 
HTML fixtures within javascript tests written using Jasmine and JSTestDriver. 

To use this follow these steps:

1. Add the dependency for your gem in Gemfile:

gem 'js_fixtures'

2. Within the controller specs, call the method to create fixtures as follows:

save_fixture(html_for('body'),'Signup')

The above will save the content of the body in file Signup.js in the path 'spec/javascripts/helpers/'. The file will have a method loadSignupFixture which contains the HTML fixture.
3. Call the same in the JS tests in beforeEach section:

beforeEach(function () {
    $(this).ready(function () {
      loadSignupFixture()
    });
});
